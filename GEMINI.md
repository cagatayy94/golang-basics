# Project Overview

This repository is a collection of basic Go programming examples. It serves as a personal cookbook for learning and referencing Go concepts. The project is structured as a series of small, self-contained Go programs, each demonstrating a specific feature of the language.

## Building and Running

Each numbered directory is a standalone Go program. To run any of the examples, navigate to the directory and use the `go run` command.

For example, to run the "hello world" example:

```bash
cd 0001_declare-variables
go run main.go
```

To run the Gin framework example:

```bash
cd 0033_gin_framework_hello_world
go run main.go
```

## Development Conventions

*   Each example is contained in its own directory, named with a number and a descriptive title (e.g., `0001_declare-variables`).
*   Each example has a `main.go` file with a `main` package.
*   The code is intended to be simple and easy to understand, focusing on a single concept.
